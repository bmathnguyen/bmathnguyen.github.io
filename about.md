I am currently a 12-grade highschooler at Hanoi - Amsterdam Highschool for the Gifted. I'm interested in maths, data science, artificial intellegent, and also physics.

## Education

I pursue my middle school at Giang Vo Secondary School, then go on to Hanoi - Amsterdam, majoring at Mathematics.

## Interest
### Maths
I'm building a comprehensive notes for Olympiad maths enthusiasts, with the aim of helping students with summarizing their studies, as there are many fields in olympiad maths.
I'm planning to share the source code later on my [Github](https://github.com/bmathnguyen) and [Blog](https://bmathnguyen.github.io/)
### CS
I am studying 2 courses on Coursera, namely Cryptography 1 by Stanford University and the first course in Machine Learning series by DeepLearning.AI

I have some future projects that are still not deployed yet, stay tuned!
