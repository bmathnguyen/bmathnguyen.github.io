**G1.** Let $$ABCDE$$ be a convex pentagon such that $$BC=DE$$. Suppose there exists a point $$T$$ inside the pentagon satisfying $$TB=TD, TC=TE, $$\angle$$TBA=$$\angle$$AET.

Let $$P$$ and $$Q$$ be the intersections of $$CD$$ and $$CT$$ with $$AB$$, respectively. Let $$R$$ and $$S$$ be the intersections of $$CD$$ and $$DT$$ with $$AE$$, respectively.

Suppose that $$P, B, A, Q$$ and $$R, E, A, S$$ are collinear in that order. Prove that $$P, S, Q, R$$ are concyclic.

**Proof. (bmathnguyen)**

First, let's exploit the given equalities in the problem: $$TB=TD, TE=TC, BC=ED$$.\\

We see that $$\(\triangle TDE = \triangle TBC\)$$ (by c.c.c).

From (*) we deduce $$\(\angle ETD=\angle BTC \Rightarrow \triangle ETC=\triangle BTD \Rightarrow \angle ECV=\angle UDB\)$$ (as both triangles $$\(\triangle ETC\)$$ and $$\(\triangle BTD\)$$ are isosceles at $$T$$).

From the problem statement: $$\(\angle TEA=\angle TBA\)$$, to combine with $$\(\angle TEC=\angle TBD\)$$ and $$\(\angle ECT=\angle TDB\)$$ as just shown, we introduce points $$U$$ and $$V$$.

Let $$U$$ be the intersection of $$DT$$ and $$AB$$, and $$V$$ be the intersection of $$CT$$ and $$AE$$.

Then, $$\(\triangle CEV \sim \triangle DBU\)$$ (by g.g) with $$\(\angle E=\angle B\)$$ and $$\(\angle C=\angle D\)$$.

From (**) we obtain $$\(\angle QVA=\angle SUA\)$$, thus quadrilateral $$UVQS$$ is cyclic.\\

Now, to prove that quadrilateral $$PRQS$$ is cyclic, it is enough to show that $$UV$$ is parallel to $$PR$$. This is the moment to apply Thales' theorem.\\

We will prove:

\[
\frac{PU}{PA} = \frac{RV}{RA}
\]

We have 

\[
VT = \frac{PU}{PB} \cdot \frac{PB}{PA} = \frac{DU}{DB} \cdot \frac{\sin CDT}{\sin CDB} \cdot \frac{CB}{CA} \cdot \frac{\sin DCB}{\sin DCA}
\]

We also have

\[
VP = \frac{RV}{RE} \cdot \frac{RE}{RA} = \frac{CV}{CE} \cdot \frac{\sin DCK}{\sin DCE} \cdot \frac{DE}{DA} \cdot \frac{\sin CDE}{\sin ADC}
\]

We just need to prove:

\[
\frac{DU}{DB} \cdot \frac{CB}{CA} \cdot \frac{CE}{CV} \cdot \frac{DA}{DE} = \frac{\sin DCT}{\sin CDT} \cdot \frac{\sin CDB}{\sin DCB} \cdot \frac{\sin DCA}{\sin ADC} \cdot \frac{\sin CDE}{\sin DCE}
\]

This is equivalent to:

\[
\frac{DU}{DB} \cdot \frac{CB}{CA} \cdot \frac{CE}{CV} \cdot \frac{DA}{DE} = \frac{TD}{TC} \cdot \frac{BC}{BD} \cdot \frac{DA}{AC} \cdot \frac{DA}{AC} \cdot \frac{EC}{ED}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{DU}{CV} = \frac{TD}{TC}
\]

The last equality holds true because from (**), and the fact that triangles $$\(\triangle TEC\)$$ and $$\(\triangle TDB\)$$ are isosceles, we have:

\[
\frac{DU}{CV} = \frac{DB}{CE} = \frac{TD}{TC}
\]
